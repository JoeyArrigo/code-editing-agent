# Simple Coding Agent Project

## Overview
This project is primarily based on the exercise described in the blog post at https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent about building a simple coding agent. The original tutorial provided a foundational approach to creating an AI-powered coding assistant.

## Project Extensions
I extended the original agent by adding a specialized tool for converting Unix timestamps. This addition was motivated by the model's initial difficulty in accurately converting Unix time to human-readable dates.

## Other Notes
- The following files (`fizzbuzz.js`, `fizzbuzz-created.txt`, and this `README.md`) were created entirely by the AI agent
- The project demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted code generation
- Code and documentation should be carefully reviewed before use
